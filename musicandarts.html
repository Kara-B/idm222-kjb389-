        <p> 
        Music and Arts is a company based in Frederick, Maryland. They have been in operation for almost 70 years now and they have over 200 physical stores nationwide. It's a company that I have a strong, personal connection to. My brothers and I have been using music and arts for years to maintenance our instruments and I recently became aware of the state of their website. A cluttered homepage and frustrating navigation led me to create a redesign concept for the site.

        <p>
          In my redesign, I considered what redoing the homepage, repair/rental page, and menu bar might look like. Music and arts thrives on their ability to provide for students and educators. Because of this, I wanted to find a way to maintain the business aspects of the site while introducing a lighter, more fun display for the site-goers. This was my first website redesign and I feel like the research and work taught me a lot as I continue to work on this and other projects more in the future.
